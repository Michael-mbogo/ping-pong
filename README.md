# Ping Pong
 ## By Michael Mbogo 	
 ## Description
 The project was about creating a ping pong game that helps us know the divisible numbers of 3,5 and 15, where the divisibles were changed to ping, pong and pingpong respectively.
 We were also required to use different styles to make the project look nice.

 ## Setup instructions.	 
The projects has used a couple of different languages, first is the html langauge where I had to input all the code, that is words that you see in the phase of the project the images, logos, input area and also the buttons. I have also used css langauge this entails styles put in the project. E.g Background images, font sizes, the font styles and the colors. Css has also helped in styling the images and the logos in that they appear in the exact posiotion they are. I have aslo used java script, this is the function that helps to changes the numberes to ping, pong and pingpong as the results are displayed.
